## Before you attend the practical session in Week 4:
You will need Anaconda for Python (for any OS) installed on your computer. We will use Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook to learn Python. From the main menu, see **Python Reference Guide > Python: Installation Guide** for more information about installing Anaconda on your computer.


## Local installation (Linux)
We suggest you use [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/) (or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)) to manage a virtual environment and install dependencies.


### First, create an environment with the following command:

```bash
$ conda create -n workshop_python
```

### If you need to run under this environment at any time, use the following command to activate it and open the notebook:

```bash
$ conda activate workshop_python

$ jupyter notebook
```
